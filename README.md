# Cluster-Project
# 🍷 Wine Clustering with KMeans and t-SNE

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to perform **clustering analysis** on a wine dataset. The data contains the results of chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy, derived from three different cultivars (types of grapes).

## 📌 Project Goals

- Explore and understand the structure of wine data using **EDA**
- Preprocess the data using **standard scaling**
- Apply **KMeans Clustering** to group similar wines
- Use **t-SNE** for dimensionality reduction and visualization
- Evaluate and interpret clustering results

---

## 📁 Dataset Description
- Original labels removed for **unsupervised** learning
- 13 chemical features:
  - Alcohol, Malic acid, Ash, Alcalinity of ash, Magnesium, Total phenols, Flavanoids, etc.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

| Step                     | Tool/Concept                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Data Exploration         | `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib` |
| Feature Scaling          | `StandardScaler` from `sklearn`   |
| Clustering               | `KMeans` from `sklearn`           |
| Visualization (2D)       | `t-SNE` from `sklearn.manifold`   |




💡 Learnings
This project helped reinforce:

Data preprocessing is essential before clustering

t-SNE is powerful for visual intuition, not modeling

Unsupervised learning can reveal hidden patterns in data
